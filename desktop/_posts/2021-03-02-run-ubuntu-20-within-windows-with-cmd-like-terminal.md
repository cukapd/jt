• Pros:

• Run ubuntu commandline, same as cmd within windows

• Shift + RightClick = option for ubuntu cmd (+ like powershell)

• Feature like termux for android


{: .box-note}
• Steps:

1. Copy the following link.

   Link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71){:target="_blank"}

2. Go to AdGuard website. 

   (This will generate a direct link as an alternative to download app from microsoft store)

   Link: [https://store.rg-adguard.net/](https://store.rg-adguard.net/){:target="_blank"}

3. Paste the copied link in search box of adguard's website.

4. Now 4 links would be generated. 

   Download the app from the last (fourth) link (~866.08 MB).

5. Install ubuntu lts 20.0.4 and restart pc

6. Now run the commandline for ubuntu lts and configure (name passwd etc)

7. Optionally add the ubuntu cmd to taskbar (for ease of access)

8. You now can access the ubuntu terminal from any folder. 

9. Goto any folder in file explorer. Shift+RightClick and choose open ubuntu commandline here. 

   Hey. You have made it correct. Ran ubuntu in windows ;)
